# EID prototype

Every technological project arises with the purpose of solving a social problem, in this case, the problem we are trying to solve is the inefficiency of the different organizations, whether business or government, to process paperwork and validate documentation of different types.
The time involved in these processes is usually extensive, but their digital counterpart often lacks the security that is necessary for certain situations. That is why we created a device that is associated with an individual person and gives them the opportunity to digitally sign documents securely, as well as store contacts of interest and generate and store secure keys.
The project is based on the pillars of asymmetric encryption, which is made up of a public key and a private key that are related to each other. This allows multiple applications, among them, the digital signature that consists of encrypting a message with the private key and then verifying its use with the public key. In this way, with a private key one has the power of the signature and therefore it is of fundamental importance that it lives in a secure environment, that it is not lost or used by those who should not be used and from there arises our device that aims to provide the necessary protection so that the system in question can be used to facilitate digital administrative processes. We intend to develop a platform that includes the following functionalities:
- Information decryption encryption for the establishment of secure communications between the parties
- Validation of identity and digital signature of documents to carry out all kinds of procedures
- Generation and storage of secure keys
- Cold storage of symmetric and asymmetric keys

# Notes

This project was developed for academic purposes in a limited period of time, so the proposed security is not guaranteed.
The languages used throughout the project are C and C++.
