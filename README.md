# EID prototype

Prototype of an electronic identification device built with the porpouse of solve the inefficiency of different organizations, whether business or government, to process paperwork and validate documentation of different types.

The time involved in these processes is usually extensive, but their digital counterpart often lacks the security that is necessary for certain situations. That is why we created a device that is associated with an individual person and gives them the opportunity to digitally sign documents securely, as well as store contacts of interest and generate and store secure keys.

The projects aims to provide the following functions:
- Information encryption and decryption for the establishment of secure communications between the parties
- Validation of identity and digital signature of documents to carry out all kinds of procedures
- Generation and storage of secure keys
- Cold storage of symmetric and asymmetric keys

# Notes

This project was developed for academic purposes in a limited period of time, so the proposed security is not guaranteed.
The languages used throughout the project are C and C++.
